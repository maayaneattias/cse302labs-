TO DO:
1)enriching the intermediate representation in terms of TAC into a control flow graph (CFG): CFG inference from linearized TAC
2)perform some simple control flow optimizations: 
• Coalescing of linear chains of blocks,
• Unreachable code elimination(UCE)
• Jump threading for unconditional jump sequences
• Jump threading to turn conditional jumps into unconditional jumps
3)Serialization of the CFG back to ordinary TAC
