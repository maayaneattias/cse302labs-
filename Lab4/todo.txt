Checkpoint 3:

TAC Improvements
-distinction between global name with @ and local name with %
- all global variables and procedures will be global names.
-Three new instruction opcodes have been added to TAC: param, call and ret.
-All the other instructions have now been modified to allow global variables for argument and destinations, in
addition to temporaries as before.
-The print() statement is no longer a proper statement in BX,so the corresponding print opcode has now been removed from TAC. 


-[{global variable}, procedures] 
-for a procedure now: any name for proc,  args[], body
-in body: can now take global variables and named temporaries as operands in args[]

X64 Improvements:
-Compiling global variables: in .data section
